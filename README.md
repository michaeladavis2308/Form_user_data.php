# Form_user_data.php this is my first php assignment from backend programming course. 
As a novice, I was asked to create a form and use the $_POST method to get data from the form and save it into a csv. file.
well, well, I still new at this so I found difficulty filtering through all the codes and examples I found on the internet.
Better still, I was able to narrow down and shared my final code for review and comments, thanks
